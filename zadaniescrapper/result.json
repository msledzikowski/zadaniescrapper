                "p2": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The White House on Wednesday launched the first standard on cutting carbon emissions from federal buildings as part of the Biden administration's policy on curbing climate change.",
                "p3": "The Federal Building Performance Standard requires federal agencies to cut energy use and electrify equipment and appliances to achieve zero emissions in 30% of their buildings by square footage space by 2030. U.S. President Joe Biden wants federal buildings to be emissions free by 2045 as part of his goal of decarbonizing the economy by 2050.",
                "p4": "To get there, agencies will be buying American-made products such as heat pumps, electric water heaters and other energy efficiency technologies, the White House said. The U.S. government is the largest owner and operator of buildings in the country.",
                "p5": "The standard could be overturned by an incoming president whose policy on climate change differs from Biden's.",
                "p6": "But Brenda Mallory, head of the White House's Council on Environmental Quality, told reporters that administration officials expect efforts to progress as efficiency saves money. \"Once we are underway on these plans they really make so much sense for the federal government in terms of the cost, in terms of really reducing both our footprint and the impacts that our operations are causing,\" she said.",
                "p7": "The Department of Energy (DOE) also said on Wednesday it is seeking public comments on a proposed rule that would set emissions reductions targets and more electrification in new federal buildings as well as federal buildings undertaking major renovations.",
                "p8": "The rule, which requires all new federal buildings by 2025 to reduce onsite fossil fuel consumption including natural gas by 90% compared to 2003 levels, is expected to save $8 million a year in federal building costs, the department said.",
                "p9": "The moves are the latest in a growing push to slash natural gas use in all U.S. buildings, including commercial and residential, which account for more than a third of the country's greenhouse gas emissions, when heating them is considered, said U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm.",
                "p10": "\"We will be setting a gold standard for new construction all across America,\" Granholm said.",
                "p11": "The American Gas Association industry group decried the proposed DOE rule and said shifting buildings to run on more electricity will increase demand for power from plants fueled by natural gas.",
                "p12": "\"Eliminating natural gas in federal buildings is an impractical, unscientific and expensive idea that will have no environmental benefit,\" said Karen Harbert, AGA president and chief executive."

                "p6": "Dutch customs, who oversee the major Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp trade and storage hub, UK enforcement authorities, and the Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) will check official certificates of origin for import ships. In case of doubt, UK and Dutch customs can request additional documents to help determine origin, such as contractual agreements, invoices, or bills of lading. ICE will also look at discharge certificates and proof from refiners that stock is locally refined. Participants using the U.S.-based CME group's exchanges must have their own legal advice and consult delivery terminals to ensure sanctions compliance.",
                "p7": "WHEN DOES A CHANGE OF ORIGIN OCCUR?",
                "p8": "To accept any diesel as of non-Russian origin, Britain, the European Union and the ICE require it to be substantially processed outside Russia.",
                "p9": "\"Processing is regarded as substantial only if it results in the manufacture of a new product or represents an important stage in manufacture, and it takes places in an undertaking equipped for that purpose,\" the UK Government website says. Blending Russian diesel elsewhere with a non-Russian equivalent would not change its origin, while refining Russian Urals crude into diesel elsewhere would.",
                "p10": "HOW EFFECTIVE ARE THE CHECKS?",
                "p11": "Britain, the EU and ICE consider diesel to be Russian if it is shipped and reloaded elsewhere. Britain says any processing to change the product must be done for commercial purposes, such as making a finished product to meet new UK specifications, not to avoid the sanctions regime. But is it virtually impossible to trace the origin of blended or refined diesel and difficult to track ship-to-ship (STS) transfers, meaning these aspects of the sanctions depend heavily on \"good will\", two industry sources familiar with import and tracking processes said.",
                "p12": "The volumes of STS operations between Russian-affiliated tankers have \"dramatically increased\" since February, maritime analytics company Windward said.",

The sources declined to be named because they were not authorised to speak to the media.",
                "p15": "HOW WILL THIS AFFECT DIESEL FLOWS?",
                "p16": "Russian diesel is likely to be delivered to and re-exported from countries such as India and Turkey, market sources said.",
                "p17": "Russia could use its fleet to move diesel into Turkey where it can be transferred onto medium-range tankers, two industry sources said.",
                "p18": "\"I would have thought that Turkey is re-exporting the barrels or perhaps substituting in-country and exporting more of their domestic output,\" lead analyst at Kpler Kevin Wright said.",

                "p20": "Britain, the EU and ICE consider diesel refined from Urals outside Russia to be a non-Russian product, which is likely to result in a further shift in trade flows. Europe has already started to replace Russian diesel imports with refined product from the Middle East, but analysts also expect India to refine more Urals and increase diesel exports to Europe.",

                "p23": "The EU price cap, which came into effect on Dec. 5, prohibits shipping, insurance and re-insurance companies from handling cargoes of Russian crude, unless it is sold for less than the $60 price set by the Group of Seven nations and its allies. Many of the larger oil companies, including BP (NYSE:BP) and Shell (LON:RDSa) have self-imposed sanctions on Russian oil and oil products.",
                "p24": "And Russia's determination to stop selling oil to countries or companies abiding by the price cap, coupled with insurance difficulties, means \"mainstream tanker owners will be unable to lift Russian crude,\" French shipbroking firm BRS said.",
                "p25": "But smaller trading companies are already using shadow fleet tankers, several industry sources said, adding these have arranged insurance with providers in India.",
                "p26": "BRS says 111 elderly tankers have been sold to private shipping companies since February probably to transport Russian oil.",
                "p27": "European buyers are also increasingly receiving Russian diesel under the Delivered Ex-ship Incoterms rule, which leaves the responsibility for insurance in the hands of the supplier, an industry source said.",

                "p29": "Dutch cooperative Rabobank expects this \"flux of a global rerouting\" to result in higher logistical costs, tighter tanker supply, and ultimately higher prices of imported energy products. \"There is a 35-45 million barrel global deficit in middle distillates,\" Rabobank said. \"This structural problem is going to last years.\""

U.S. gas pump prices are down almost 30% from June peaks.",

                "p3": "Carbon credits - generated through activities such as planting forests or pulling climate-damaging carbon dioxide from the air - are sold to polluters to offset their emissions as a way of helping them reach net-zero emissions to limit global warming.",

                "p7": "The new database - called the Climate Action Data Trust (CAD Trust) - aims to address these issues by collating all the project and carbon credit data in one place and making it free to the public.",

                "p3": "The price cap was imposed on Monday by the G7 industrial democracies and Australia at a level above the current price for Urals crude from Russia, the world's second largest oil exporter.",

                "p9": "The official did not detail what was meant by leverage, though it was apparently a reference to Treasury's belief that the cap puts Russia in a bind. Treasury is \"skeptical\" that Russia would be able to sell all of its oil exports above the price cap to countries including India and China, the official said.",
                "p10": "In separate remarks, Treasury Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing Elizabeth Rosenberg, said that the policy was specifically designed to allow India and China to continue purchasing Russian crude, but at deeper discounts.",
                "p11": "Moscow may refuse to sell oil to countries observing the price cap, but this \"would force them to shut in their oil, denying them revenue and potentially taxing and damaging their medium- to long-term drilling, refining, and storage infrastructure,\" Rosenberg said at an American Conference Institute sanctions conference in Washington.",

                "p6": "\u201cIt\u2019s all shadow boxing, if you ask me, what Russia and the EU are doing on the so-called ban and price cap on Russian oil,\u201d said John Kilduff, founding partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital. \u201cNeither side is really doing anything to hurt the movement of oil in the market. It\u2019s all talk and no real action. In light of that, the market figures all is fine for now despite Russia and OPEC trying to scare everyone with talk of a supply squeeze.\u201d",
                "p7": "The European Union officially stopped importing oil directly from Russia as of December 5. Simultaneously, a price cap of $60 per barrel on Russian crude came into effect on Monday. Both measures are aimed at punishing Russia for its war against Ukraine and creating a cash crunch for Moscow, which relies heavily on earnings from oil and gas for spending in almost everything.",
                "p8": "Under the price cap, non-EU nations importing seaborne Russian crude cannot get shipping, insurance and reinsurance services from established Western companies in the business if they pay more than $60 per barrel. That could complicate the shipment of Russian crude priced above the cap, even to countries which are not part of the agreement. Russian Urals crude traded at around $67 a barrel on Friday.",
                "p9": "The Kremlin has vowed not to do business with any country that tries to apply the price cap on Russian oil. But industry experts said it might not be entirely possible for Moscow to escape Western shipping and financial services that were tied to the price cap.",
                "p10": "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov reiterated on Monday that Russia \u201cwill not accept\" any price cap on its oil and was analyzing how to respond. The West\u2019s action would destabilize global energy markets but not affect Moscow\u2019s ability to sustain what it calls its \"special military operation\" in Ukraine, Peskov added.",
                "p11": "But other than talk so far, the Russians haven\u2019t done anything in retaliation.",
                "p12": "OPEC+, on its end, left production by the 23 oil producers in its alliance unchanged when the group met on Sunday \u2014 presumably in anticipation of a severe crude supply squeeze in Europe should the Kremlin retaliate against the West\u2019s price cap.",
                "p13": "OPEC+ \u2014 which represents the 13-member Saudi-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and 10 other oil producers steered by Russia \u2014 had announced in October a 2 million-barrels-per-day reduction that is to last through 2023.",
                "p14": "But it has become a habit for oil bulls to expect OPEC+ to announce a production cut each time the group meets. Since Sunday\u2019s meeting yielded nothing, crude prices unsurprisingly fell.",
                "p15": "Crude traders have also been affected since Monday by macro developments in risk markets as the dollar rallied this week after orders for U.S. factory-made goods rose 1% in October. It was the 12th increase in 13 months for factory orders versus manufacturing, which contracted in November for the first time in 2-1/2 years, according to a measure by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM).",
                "p16": "Separately, the ISM-tracked non-manufacturing sector showed a reading of 56.5 in November on Monday, versus 54.4 in October. Economists had predicted a reading of 53.3 for last month.",
                "p17": "The economic data meant one thing: the Fed could turn aggressive with rate hikes again in the new year.",
                "p18": "\u201cThe thinking is that we might not be at the peak of U.S. rates after all,\u201d economist Adam Button said in a post on the ForexLive forum. \u201cFor sure the Fed is going to pause at some point next year around 5% but if the numbers keep running hot like this, they won't pause for long. The worry is that 5% rates aren't going to be enough and the Fed will eventually have to hike to 6-7% (or higher). The issue is that we don't really know how the U.S. economy will react to those rates then. It's been so long since the U.S. has had genuinely high rates that it's a tough call.\u201d",
                "p19": "The Fed has added 375 basis points to rates since March. Prior to that, rates peaked at just 25 basis points, as the central bank slashed them to nearly zero after the global outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020.",
                "p20": "After four straight jumbo-sized hikes of 75 basis points between June and November, markets expect the Fed to impose a smaller increase of 50 basis points at its upcoming rate decision on Dec. 14."

                "p21": "About 4% of its shale drilling inventory remains high producing, or Tier 1, locations, down from 9% at the start of 2020, according to production technology firm Novi Labs, which focuses on oil and gas well returns.",
                "p22": "As the number of prime drilling locations decline across all shale fields, the outlook is grim. Shale production declines rapidly after peaking compared to conventional oil wells, falling about 50% after the first year.",
                "p23": "\"It's kind of a canary in the coal mine for what's going to happen in the other unconventional oil plays,\" said Ted Cross, director of product management Novi Labs and a former oil company geologist, referring to North Dakota.",
                "p24": "The Permian Basin of west Texas and New Mexico, the largest and most important U.S. oilfield, is the only U.S. shale region to exceed its pre-COVID-19 pandemic oil production levels, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data.",
                "p25": "Even that field is showing signs of stress.",
                "p26": "\"There are a bunch of underlying causes, but frac sand is so expensive now, tight labor markets make last-mile logistics difficult, and public producers are generally more willing to miss on production than on capex,\" said Matt Hagerty, a senior analyst for FactSet's BTU Analytics.",
                "p27": "Initial production rates on a new well in the Central Midland basin section of the Permian averages about 790 barrels per day of oil, according to researcher BTU, down from 830 bpd just six months ago. Its outlook for initial output in another shale field, the eastern Eagle Ford, is down to 778 bpd from 828 bpd.",
                "p28": "PERSISTENT LABOR SHORTAGES",
                "p29": "\"We're going to go into 2023 with a serious workforce shortage,\" said North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources Director Lynn Helms. The northern state has historically had difficulty attracting workers, and the tight labor market has worsened the problem.",
                "p30": "Attracting laborers for crews needed to run frac fleets and rigs has been stubbornly difficult, Helms said, adding that more drilling rigs have moved south to the Permian.",
                "p31": "The number of oil and gas extraction workers in North Dakota fell by 12% between 2019 and 2021, the most recent annual Bureau of Labor Statistics data show, compared to New Mexico's 9.6% drop.",
                "p32": "Lower production rates are \"a longer-term prospect,\" said Mike Oestmann, chief executive of shale producer Tall City Exploration. Other issues depressing potential shale gains: a lack of regulatory clarity and the U.S. government's desire to shift away from fossil fuels, he said.",
                "p33": "With producers determined to put limited resources into the best drilling prospects, \"we won't be able to keep this up forever,\" said Kaes Van't Hof, finance chief at Diamondback (NASDAQ:FANG) Energy, in a recent earnings call.",

                "p2": "Investing.com-- Gold prices sank below key levels on Tuesday, with metal markets back under pressure as stronger-than-expected U.S. data boosted the dollar and ramped up uncertainty over strength in the U.S. economy and how the Federal Reserve will respond to it.",
                "p3": "The dollar rose for the first session in four on Monday, recovering from a five-month low after U.S. factory orders and services sector data showed that some facets of the economy were running well above expectations, which could feed into inflationary pressures.",
                "p4": "This could push the Fed into raising rates for longer than expected, especially if inflation remains stubbornly above the central bank\u2019s target range. While the Fed has flagged smaller rate hikes in the coming months, the central bank also warned that rates could peak at much higher-than-expected levels.",
                "p5": "Such a scenario would be negative for most non-yielding assets, with gold likely to be impacted the most. The central bank is now set to meet next week in its last meeting for 2022.",
                "p6": "Spot gold was flat around $1,769.30 an ounce, while gold futures were steady at $1,781.55 an ounce. Both instruments tumbled around 1.7% on Monday, their worst day in nearly three months.",
                "p7": "Rising interest rates were the biggest weight on bullion prices this year, as higher yields on debt pushed up the opportunity cost of holding gold.

                "p8": "Other precious metals were also subdued on Tuesday after falling sharply in the prior session. Platinum futures fell 0.1%, while silver futures were flat around $22.422 an ounce. Both metals plunged 2.4% and 4.4% on Monday, respectively.",
                "p9": "Among industrial metals, copper prices reversed early gains on Monday as fears of higher interest rates largely offset optimism over a potential recovery in Chinese demand.",

                "p1": "By Julia Payne and Jonathan Saul",
                "p2": "LONDON (Reuters) - The market for old oil tankers is booming, and it's all down to efforts by Western nations to curb trade in Russian crude.",
                "p3": "As Western shipping and maritime services firms steer clear of Russian oil to avoid falling foul of sanctions or harming their reputations, new companies have leapt into the void, and they're snapping up old tankers that might normally be scrapped.",
                "p4": "The European Union banned all seaborne Russian crude imports from Dec. 5, with a fuel import ban to follow in February.",
                "p5": "It also banned companies and individuals in the bloc from providing financing, brokerage, shipping and insurance services to ship Russian oil elsewhere if the crude was bought above a price cap of $60 a barrel that came into effect on Monday.",
                "p6": "In recent months, ageing tankers have been sold by Greek and Norwegian owners for record prices to pop-up Middle Eastern and Asian buyers taking advantage of sky-high charter prices for vessels willing to ship Russian oil to India and China.",
                "p7": "Tanker management companies such as Fractal Shipping, run out of Swiss financial hub of Geneva, are reaping the rewards.",
                "p8": "In less than a year, Fractal has put together a fleet of 23 oil and fuel tankers bought recently by owners in Dubai. Most are taking Russian crude from Baltic and Black Sea ports to Asia, Refinitiv Eikon ship tracking showed.",
                "p9": "Chief Executive Mathieu Philippe said he launched the idea for Fractal a year ago, betting that the global tanker fleet was getting stretched and that both the cost of vessels and freight rates would inevitably rise from pandemic lows.",
                "p10": "But, by the middle of this year, new ship owners, known as principals, started asking him to get into the Russian oil business.",
                "p11": "\"We were given a lot of tankers in August and September. Our principals wanted to come into the business for the Russian opportunity,\" the shipping industry veteran told Reuters.",
                "p12": "PRICE SURGE",
                "p13": "Major Western oil companies typically stop using tankers when they are about 15 years old, and many would be scrapped. Fractal's fleet, meanwhile, consists entirely of older vessels ranging from 13 to 19 years, Fractal's website shows.",
                "p14": "With new entrants keen to get a slice of the Russian business, second-hand oil tanker prices have surged, especially for Aframax vessels that can carry up to 600,000 barrels, the standard size used for loading crude at Russia's Baltic ports.",
                "p15": "The price tag for 20-year-old Aframaxes has jumped 86% from $11.8 million on Jan. 1 to $22 million now, according to valuation company VesselsValue.",
                "p16": "So far this year, 148 Aframax sales have been reported, a 5% increase from the same period in 2021, VesselsValue said.",
                "p17": "Research by ship broker Clarksons showed that more tankers were sold in the first 11 months of 2022 than any full-year previously and sales in October set a new monthly record of 76.",
                "p18": "Up until Dec. 5, there were no Western sanctions on transporting Russian oil to Asian markets, so Fractal and other management companies had not breached any rules.",
                "p19": "To avoid potential pitfalls, though, Philippe said Fractal does not deal with any Russian-owned companies. That would also be a no-go for Western banks financing maritime trade, he said.",
                "p20": "To prevent the new EU sanctions from halting millions of barrels per day of Russian crude exports and driving up global fuel costs, the Group of Seven (G7) rich nations has mitigated its impact by permitting exports below a cap of $60 a barrel.",
                "p21": "The aim of the plan is reduce to Russia's export revenue but keep oil supplies flowing.",
                "p22": "The agreement on the price cap means operations such as Fractal's can carry on shipping Russian crude without any issues, as long as the deals are below the cap.",
                "p23": "The Kremlin has repeatedly said it will not sell oil below the new price cap while Russia's two biggest buyers, China and India, have not promised to abide by the limit.",
                "p24": "SAILING TO RUSSIA",
                "p25": "New ship owners willing to transport Russian oil are cashing in. \"Ships earning $80,000 a day in the Mediterranean can make $130,000 a day if they carry Russian oil,\" said one ship broker, who declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media.",
                "p26": "Crude tanker rates have jumped to highs not seen since 2008, aside from a brief period in 2020 when oil firms scrambled for tankers to store fuel as demand crashed due to the pandemic.",
                "p27": "Tanker owners can make more than $100,000 a day for some journeys, said Omar Nokta, analyst at investment bank Jefferies.",
                "p28": "\"While it remains to be seen how the price cap on Russian exports will ultimately play out, what is clear is that the tanker fleet is becoming stretched and travelling longer distances,\" he said.",
                "p29": "More tankers are now being used for voyages taking weeks, shipping Russian oil from the Baltic and Black Sea to Asia, whereas Russian oil was mainly sold in Europe previously and the voyages only took a few days.",
                "p30": "Shipbuilding also stalled during the pandemic and deliveries of new oil tankers next year are set to be historically low, according to analysis from shipping brokers.",
                "p31": "Reuters monitored 18 of Fractal's tankers using Refinitiv Eikon ship tracking data.",
                "p32": "Twelve have loaded oil at Russian ports in the last two months either for the first time, for the first time since the Ukraine war started, or at least for the first time in over a year, the data showed. Two have been calling regularly at Russian ports.",
                "p33": "For instance, the Fractal-managed Charvi tanker loaded crude at Russia's Baltic port of Primorsk in the middle of September before sailing to discharge its cargo in Sikka, India.",
                "p34": "The tanker formerly owned by Norway's Viken Shipping under the name Storviken had never previously called at a Russian port, Refinitiv Eikon data going back to 2010 showed.",
                "p35": "Similarly, Daphne V another tanker previously owned by Viken Shipping and now managed by Fractal called at Primorsk on Nov. 11 for the first time since the Ukraine war started and is heading to the Suez Canal en route to Asia.",
                "p36": "The tanker was called Kronviken before it changed hands. Viken Shipping said it had not sold ships to Russian owners but declined to identify the buyers.",
                "p37": "Ship broker Braemar estimated that about 120 of the 212 tankers sold to likely Russian buyers this year were looking at Russian crude oil trades, while there were virtually no sales last year to buyers involved in shipping Russian crude.",
                "p38": "CIRCUMVENTING SANCTIONS",
                "p39": "The U.S. Treasury has provided some guidance about how the cap will work, but questions remain over its enforcement.",
                "p40": "\"The price cap is very confusing,\" Fractal's Philippe said. \"We are definitely one of the companies that want to remain in the Russian trade. As businessmen we have to be opportunistic.\"",
                "p41": "Buyers must provide documents such as invoices to shipping companies or insurers to show they stuck to the cap but it will be essentially down to self-monitoring, with no penalties for providers of shipping services if they operated in good faith.",
                "p42": "Deals shown to be outside the price cap would effectively break sanctions, and other vessels that have at some point been involved in circumventing oil export sanctions on Venezuela and Iran may well play a part in that trade, analysts say.",
                "p43": "One aim of the G7 price cap plan is to prevent this so-called 'dark fleet' getting bigger by allowing Russian oil exports to take place transparently without breaking sanctions.",
                "p44": "This dark fleet, which accounts for about 10% of the world's oil tankers according to Trafigura and other shipping industry sources, has helped Iran circumvent a U.S. embargo for the better part of a decade, and Venezuela since 2019.",
                "p45": "At least 21 tankers have switched to shipping Russian oil after previously being used for Iranian shipments, said Claire Jungman, chief of staff at U.S. advocacy group United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI), which monitors Iran-related tanker traffic through ship and satellite tracking.",
                "p46": "Of those vessels, at least have four changed ownership in recent months.",
                "p47": "Ship broker Braemar also said that some of the vessels involved in shipping Iranian and Venezuelan oil were shifting to transporting Russian oil.",
                "p48": "It estimated that the so-called shadow fleet shipping oil from those two countries and some of them also for Russia was made up of 107 Aframaxes, 65 larger Suezmaxes and 82 VLCCs (Very Large Crude Carriers).",
                "p49": "\"Instead of having one optimised fleet you now have two separate optimised fleets,\" said Christian M. Ingerslev, chief executive of Denmark's Maersk Tankers.",
                "p50": "\"If sanctions are continually adjusted, it becomes very difficult for the sanctions compliant companies to take the risk because they don't know what will happen tomorrow,\" he said."
